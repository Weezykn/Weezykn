- 👋 Hi, I’m @Weezykn
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code, so that I may shift careers from the manual labor jobs I've worked the past decade
- 🌱 I’m currently learning via TheOdinProject.com
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything entry level that might help me develop deeper understanding as I learn the fundamentals
- 📫 How to reach me - weezykn@gmail.com
